# CPP ECOLE 42

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
<br>
<br>
The goal of these modules is an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
<br>
<br>
This will be the starting point of a C++ journey
